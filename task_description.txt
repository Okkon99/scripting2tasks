the tasks are described below
you will deliver the completed tasks through a clone of this git repository by just commiting your changes on top of it
clone, or fork, this repository to a copy in your personal workspace on PSQ's gitlab

1. make a simple game that runs only inside of ScriptGame.cs and outputs to Debug.Log and GUI.Label. rules below!

2. make the same game, but fully on unity's terms. using prefabs, component scripts and the various functions that unity provides.
simple graphics to represent what is happening like cubes that appear/disappear and move slightly when attacked & attacking.
the game starts with GameClass.cs
creative freedom outside of this is encouraged, but not at the expense of finishing it in time obviously :)

I will help you if you are unsure about where to start, or continue, or anything really.
it can be made in an infinite amount of ways, the important part is to practice how to apply coding.


parameters of the game:
--------------------

there are 2 types of actors: one player and x amount of enemies
a class that contains game rules is required in this design

per class, the data they contain is:
GameRules:
game_level                          (starts at 1, increased by levelup-game)
max_mana                            (starts at 100.0)
mana_upgrade_cost                   (100.0, constant)
max_mana_purchase_increase          (50.0, constant)
player_mana_generated_per_second    (20.0, constant)
player_mana_boost_per_level  (2.5, constant)

Player:
mana  (0.0-max_mana, starts at 0.0)
level (starts at 1, increase by levelup-player)
    a label is displayed for each player level (1 to 9) - private, private 1st class, corporal, sergeant, major, officer, captain, colonel, general

Enemy:
hp (0.0-100.0, starts at 100.0)

rules:
if player reaches level 10, you win.
if the number of enemies reaches 10, you lose. (starts at 0 enemies)

player can take 3 actions:
1 - attack the first enemy in the list. if enemy hp reaches 0, remove it from the list. 
    attacking with mana damages 1 hp per 1 mana, uses all mana until first enemy is dead or out of mana.

2 - levelup-player. mana is spent for this and the cost is 
    ( 100.0 + 5.0 * game_level + 10.0 * number_of_enemies )
    if the player can afford it, level up player

3 - purchase max mana. if player can afford the cost (mana_upgrade_cost),
    max_mana is increased by max_mana_purchase_increase and player mana is deducted


mana of player is increased every frame according to function:
    ( player_mana_generated_per_second + player_mana_boost_per_level * player_level ) per second, never above max_mana

OnGameLevelIncreaseEvent - levelup-game, game is leveled up by 1

OnEnemySpawnEvent - one enemy is added to the collection of enemies
