1.
create a player that can move around and jump

2.
create two different mechanics like "pickup item" or "activate item when walking over/onto"

3.
create two different obstacle of any kind that can be bypassed by using the picked up item or activated mechanics

4.
define some goals for the level
use events to communicate game progress, however many obstacles you have for the level
make the game respond to the game progress meeting the goals, for example activate a win condition for the level (only a Debug.Log() is necessary as a win condition)
